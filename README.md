This software module connects a home power station from E3/DC to an MQTT broker.
It uses the RSCP interface of the S10 device.

The solution is based on the RSCP sample application provided by E3/DC and was developed and tested with a Raspberry Pi and a Linux PC (x86_64).

The tool fetches the data cyclically from the S10 and publishes it to the MQTT broker under certain [topics](TOPICS.md).

Supported topic areas are:

- Energy topics for today
- Current power values
- Autarky and self-consumption
- Battery status
- Energy management (EMS) power settings
- Data from yesterday and the current week, month and year
- Values of the power meter (PM)
- Values of the photovoltaic inverter (PVI)
- Values of the emergency power supply (EP)
- Values of the wallbox (WB)

For continuous provision of values, you can configure several topics that are published in each cycle. Default: Only modified values will be published.

## Features

- (new) Topic prefix is configurable
- E3/DC [wallbox](WALLBOX.md) topics
- [InfluxDB](INFLUXDB.md) support
- Topics for temperatures (battery, PVI)
- Idle periods
- System error messages
- (new) Details of the battery modules (DCB)
- (new) Additional topics for PVI
- (new) Units as InfluxDB tags
- Docker image at https://hub.docker.com/r/pvtom/rscp2mqtt

## Docker

Instead of installing the package you can use a [Docker image](DOCKER.md).

## Prerequisite

- An MQTT broker in your environment
- rscp2mqtt needs the library libmosquitto. For installation please enter:

```
sudo apt-get install libmosquitto-dev
```

If you like to transfer data to InfluxDB install the libcurl library:
```
sudo apt-get install curl libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

## Cloning the Repository

```
sudo apt-get install git # if necessary
git clone https://github.com/pvtom/rscp2mqtt.git
cd rscp2mqtt
```

## Compilation

To build a program version without InfluxDB use:
```
make
```

To build a program version including InfluxDB support use:
```
make WITH_INFLUXDB=yes
```

## Installation

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/rscp2mqtt
sudo chown pi:pi /opt/rscp2mqtt/
```
Adjust user and group (pi:pi) if you use another user.

Copy `rscp2mqtt` into the directory `/opt/rscp2mqtt`

```
cp -a rscp2mqtt /opt/rscp2mqtt
```

## Configuration

Copy the config template file into the directory `/opt/rscp2mqtt`
```
cp config.template /opt/rscp2mqtt/.config
```

Please change to the directory `/opt/rscp2mqtt` and edit `.config` to adjust to your configuration:

```
cd /opt/rscp2mqtt
nano .config
```

```
// IP address of the E3/DC S10 device
E3DC_IP=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
// Port of the E3/DC S10 device, default is 5033
E3DC_PORT=5033
// E3/DC account
E3DC_USER=your_e3dc_user
E3DC_PASSWORD=your_e3dc_password
// AES password
E3DC_AES_PASSWORD=your_aes_password
// Target MQTT broker
MQTT_HOST=your_mqtt_broker
// Default port is 1883
MQTT_PORT=1883
// MQTT user / password authentication necessary? Depends on the MQTT broker configuration.
MQTT_AUTH=false
// if true, then enter here
MQTT_USER=
MQTT_PASSWORD=
// MQTT parameters
MQTT_QOS=0
MQTT_RETAIN=false
// Topic prefix (max 24 characters), default is e3dc
PREFIX=e3dc 
// log file
LOGFILE=/tmp/rscp2mqtt.log
// Interval requesting the E3/DC S10 device in seconds (1..10)
INTERVAL=1
// enable PVI requests, default is true
PVI_REQUESTS=true
// number of available PV strings(trackers), default is 2
PVI_TRACKER=2
// enable PM requests, default is true
PM_REQUESTS=true
// use external PM (S10 Mini), default is false
PM_EXTERN=false
// enable DCB (details for battery modules) requests, default is true
DCB_REQUESTS=true
// Auto refresh, default is false
AUTO_REFRESH=false
// Disable MQTT publish support (dryrun mode)
DISABLE_MQTT_PUBLISH=false
// Wallbox, default is false
WALLBOX=true
// topics to be published in each cycle (regular expressions)
FORCE_PUB=e3dc/[a-z]+/power
FORCE_PUB=e3dc/battery/soc
```

The prefix of the topics can be configured by the attribute PREFIX. By default all topics start with "e3dc". This can be changed to any other string that MQTT accepts as a topic, max. 24 characters. E.g. "s10" or "s10/1".

Find InfluxDB configurations in [InfluxDB](INFLUXDB.md).

The parameter FORCE_PUB can occur several times. You can use it to define topics that will be published in each cycle, even if the values do not change. To check the definition, look at the log output after the program start.

## Program start

Start the program:

```
./rscp2mqtt
```

If everything works properly, you will see something like this:

```
Connecting...
E3DC system 192.168.178.111:5033 user: <your E3DC user>
MQTT broker localhost:1883 qos = 0 retain = false
Fetching data every second.

MQTT: publish topic >e3dc/grid/power< payload >-45<
MQTT: publish topic >e3dc/addon/power< payload >0<
MQTT: publish topic >e3dc/coupling/mode< payload >3<
...
```

Check the configuration if the connections are not established.

Notes: In the following examples I assume that the MQTT broker runs on the same machine as `rscp2mqtt` under port 1883. If the MQTT broker runs on another server, please use its name instead of `localhost` and change the port if it is different.
The default prefix `e3dc` is used for the topics. Please adjust the calls if you use a different prefix.

If you use the Mosquitto tools you can subscribe the topics with (here without user / password)

```
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'e3dc/#' -v
```

Stop `rscp2mqtt` with Crtl-C and start it in the background.

## Daemon Mode

Start the program in daemon mode:
```
./rscp2mqtt -d
```
If you like to start `rscp2mqtt` during the system start, use `/etc/rc.local`. Add the following line before `exit 0`.
```
(cd /opt/rscp2mqtt ; /usr/bin/sudo -H -u pi /opt/rscp2mqtt/rscp2mqtt -d)
```
Adjust the user (pi) if you use another user.

The daemon can be terminated with
```
pkill rscp2mqtt
```
Alternatively, `rscp2mqtt` can be managed by systemd. To do this, copy the file `rscp2mqtt.service` to the systemd directory:
```
sudo cp -a rscp2mqtt.service /etc/systemd/system/
```
Configure the service `sudo nano rscp2mqtt.service` (adjust user 'User=pi'), if needed.

Register the service and start it with:
```
sudo systemctl start rscp2mqtt
sudo systemctl enable rscp2mqtt
```
Be careful that the program runs only once.

## Logging

If stdout is redirected to another process or rscp2mqtt is started with option -s (silent mode), only the log information is passed (issue #10).

## Device Control

rscp2mqtt subscribes to the root topic "prefix/set/#" and forwards incoming requests to the S10 home power station. In this way, the device can be controlled and changes made to its configuration.

### Battery Charging

Start battery charging manually (payload is the energy [Wh] to charge)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/manual_charge" -m 1000
```

### Weather Regulation

Set weather regulation (true/1/false/0)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/weather_regulation" -m true
```

### Power Limits

Set limits for battery charging and discharging (true/1/false/0)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/power_limits" -m true
```
Set the charging and discharging power limits in [W]
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/max_charge_power" -m 2300
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/max_discharge_power" -m 4500
```

### Idle Periods

Set idle periods to lock battery charging or discharging

Note: The set operations will work only if the idle period functionality is turned on (via the S10 display).

Parameters:
- Day: "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday" or "today"
- Mode: "charge" or "discharge"
- Active: "true" or "false"
- Period: "hh:mi-hh:mi"
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/idle_period" -m "today:charge:true:00:00-23:59"
```

With the topics "e3dc/ems/charging_lock" and "e3dc/ems/discharging_lock" you can check whether a lock is currently active or not.

### Emergency Power

Set battery reserve for emergency power
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/reserve/energy" -m 1500 # in [Wh]
# or
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/reserve/percent" -m 10 # in [%]
```

### Power Management

Control the power management with "e3dc/set/power_mode":

The functionality can be used to intervene in the regulation of the power management.
Caution: This function can be used to bypass a set feed-in reduction. Use this functionality at your own risk.

Automatic / normal mode
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/power_mode" -m "auto"
```
Idle mode (number of cycles)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/power_mode" -m "idle:60"
```
Discharge mode (power in [W], number of cycles)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/power_mode" -m "discharge:2000:60"
```
Charge mode (power in [W], number of cycles)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/power_mode" -m "charge:2000:60"
```
Grid charge mode (power in [W], number of cycles)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/power_mode" -m "grid_charge:2000:60"
```

After the time has elapsed (number of cycles multiplied by the configured interval) plus a few seconds, the system automatically returns to normal mode.

Turn on the functionality in the configuration file .config, add/change the following line:
```
AUTO_REFRESH=true
```

## Wallbox Control

Set solar or mix mode with the current in [A] (6..32 Ampere)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/wallbox/control" -m "solar:16"
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/wallbox/control" -m "mix:8"
```

Stop charging
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/wallbox/control" -m "stop"
```

Set battery to car mode (true/1/false/0)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/wallbox/battery_to_car" -m true
```

Set battery before car mode (true/1/false/0)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/wallbox/battery_before_car" -m true
```

Set battery discharge until [%]
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/wallbox/battery_discharge_until" -m 80
```

Set disable charging battery at mix mode (true/1/false/0)
```
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t "e3dc/set/wallbox/disable_battery_at_mix_mode" -m true
```
